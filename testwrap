# Restore quotes to args as appropriate:
#   	We assume that any arg that includes whitespace should be quoted.
#   	The only exception is the --format option, whose argument is a format
#	string.  The format string should be quoted alone; e.g.,
#		
#		--format="<format string>"
#
#	The shell wants to strip these quotes off before passing them to wrapper.rb,
#	and I haven't figured a way around it.  We therefore also insert '%q' or '%Q',
#	which wrapper.rb will replace with quotes.
#
#	We also need to escape '<' and '>' with a '\' character.
